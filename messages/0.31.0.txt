CFML v0.31.0 Changelog:

- Updated syntax highlighting to work with the updated features in the Sublime
  Text 4 syntax highlighting engine, as well as the latest default syntax
  highlighting files released in stable build 4186

  Please note: these changes are significant and thus might introduce syntax
  highlighting errors, but the latest JavaScript syntax file bundled with
  Sublime Text causes the CFML syntax to break completely, so I decided to
  release this now to allow CFML syntax highlighting to continue to
  function.

PLEASE RESTART SUBLIME TEXT TO ENSURE THESE CHANGES ARE LOADED CORRECTLY, THANKS!
