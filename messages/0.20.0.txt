CFML v0.20.0 Changelog:

- Added the following tags to the default list of tags that do not receive a
  closing tag: `cfcontent`, `cfparam`, `cfflush`, `cffile`, `cfdirectory`,
  `cfheader`, `cfhttpparam`, `cflog`, and `cfimage`.

- Component method completions are no longer of the form `method():returntype`
  by default, as it turns out this format blocks Sublime Text from including
  local buffer completions in the completion list. Instead the completion names
  now only include the method name. It is possible to get the old completion
  name style back via a new package setting `cfc_completion_names` - the
  two options for it are "basic" and "full". (If this setting is changed, you
  will need to run the `CFML: Index Active Project` command via the command
  palette for the change to take effect for indexed components.) If you do want
  to use the old completion style a plugin such as `All Autocomplete` can be
  used as a workaround to get local buffer completions back into the completion
  list. See the issue below for more discussion:

- For Sublime Text builds 3116+ running the documentation command on mouse hover
  is now supported. This is enabled by default, but can be disabled by setting
  the package setting `cfml_hover_docs` to false in your user package settings.

- The documentation command now highlights the relevant regions of the code
  to which the displayed documentation pertains. This is enabled by default,
  but can be disabled by setting the package setting
  `inline_doc_regions_highlight` to false in your user package settings.

- When using the CFML formatting command to format the current function, it
  will now format the function declaration as well as the function body.

- When formatting a function call that contains an anonymous function, e.g.:

    myArray.map(function(item) {
      return item.key;
    });

  the anonymous function will be kept inline with the opening parenthesis,
  instead of always being placed on a new line.
